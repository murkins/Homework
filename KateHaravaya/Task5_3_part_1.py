'''Task5_3_part_1. File `data/students.csv` stores information about students in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format.
This file contains the studentâ€™s names, age and average mark.
1) Implement a function which receives file path and returns names of top performer students
```python
def get_top_performers(file_path, number_of_top_students=5):
    pass '''

import data
import csv
